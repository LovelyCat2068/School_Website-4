                <p class="list-group-item-text col-lg-7 col-md-7 col-sm-7 col-xs-12">We believe in learning through experiencing. We take matters outside the classroom to provide students with a working knowledge of the lessons they learn. We give students virtual tours of the solar system, make use of plays to enact lessons of history and play speeches given by great men such as Nehru and Lincoln to inspire greatness in our students. Students watch video lessons in class that explain concepts in creative, interesting ways. We conduct programs that instill curiosity and inquisitiveness in the younger ones. Music At Phoenix Greens, we also teach our children the culture of music and make them appreciate every genre of music. Our Instructors train our children the Eastern as well as Western forms of music during their timely music sessions. Dance and Drama We ensure we continue the dance and drama activities through the year for our children, in one way or another possible. We believe that overcoming their stage fear will not only give them confidence but also build a leadership quality in them. Quizzes and Competitions We expose our children to various quizzes and competitions such as Math and Science Olympiads, Spelling Bees, Literature, Geographical bees and more. We allow them to participate in State and International level competitions to build awareness, grow their knowledge in all fields and also bring them a sense of competitive spirit that goes beyond the boundaries of school level. We regularly host Olympiads, NSF spelling bees, Romain Rolland state and national level exam conducted for French students and other fun competitions relating to Diwali, Holi, Rakhi and more. Field Trips Field trips are a very important part of the curriculum at Phoenix Greens. We believe it is important for children to enjoy themselves on field trips, but also ensure that the trips hold high educational value - whether history-based or science-based. Children are given the opportunity experience learning outdoors, away the confines of the four walls of the classroom. Phoenix EchoPhoenix Echo is the school’s half-yearly magazine managed entirely by students. Teachers supervise the students as they carry out the development of content, design, print and expenses for the magazine and at most provide guidance where necessary. The students learn to handle budgets, maintain deadlines and manage resources in the process. Leadership Foundation Our Leadership foundation is built to pay attention to the children’s outgoing character and growing their skills in various social aspects. The school encourages leadership qualities by conducting elections every year for Junior and senior cabinet. Different clubs and committees such as Lit. club, Health and Wellness Club, IT Club and more select children for the posts of president and Secretary, to shoulder additional responsibilities.</p>
